Powers  Abyss is a mutant whose body is actually a portal to another dimension. It is possible this may be the same dimension that Nightcrawler travels through when he teleports. Abyss is also able to stretch his body and capture things in his tendril-like appendages, absorb some of their strength, and then deposit them in his pocket dimension. It is unknown whether anything can survive in this pocket dimension; it is possible that someday some of his victims could escape.  Abyss also showed signs that he may have some sort of limited telepathy or empathy.
