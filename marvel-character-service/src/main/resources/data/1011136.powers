Powers  Air-Walker had been given a portion of the Power Cosmic, and with it he could absorb and manipulate cosmic energies for a variety of purposes. It gave him god-like strength, speed, durability, endurance and agility. Air-Walker could fire blasts of heat, concussive force, magnetism, anti-gravity, and electricity. Using his power at peak capacity, Air-Walker could function for months before succumbing to fatigue. He was immune to extreme temperature changes, most radiation and can survive in the vacuum of space indefinitely without food, water, or air as well as navigate hyperspace unaided. The Power Cosmic also granted him the ability to analyze and rearrange matter and energy. When entering planetary atmospheres, he would curtail his speed as to not cause devastating side effects. He could manipulate the forces of nature, altering weather patterns, generate such states as rain or fog, produce winds of varying degrees and intensities up to hurricane force, raise or lower humidity and temperature, induce lightning or other electrical atmospheric phenomena, and dispense natural storms. Air-Walker could direct the path of certain atmospheric effects, such as bolts of lightning and could manipulate ocean currents by creating hurricanes and tidal waves. He also had "Cosmic Awareness" in the sense that he could detect various energy signatures throughout space.  Gabriel's android form could replicate all his original powers at approximately the same levels by channeling the cosmic energy through its fiery cloak, which acted as a receptor, into its cosmic cells. If drained, the cells could be recharged by an outside source. The automatic self-repair circuitry within its chest cavity would function as long as 35% of the total system was intact. Combined with the Power Cosmic, his android body could withstand large amounts of physical damage and possessed a homing beacon in tune with Galactus' worldship, Taa II.
