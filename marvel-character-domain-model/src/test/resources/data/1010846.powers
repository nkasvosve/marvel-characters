Powers  The Aegis breastplate enables Trey to surround himself with an impenetrable force-field. Its effectiveness depends on his conscious awareness of an attack; if he is taken by surprise, he can be struck or injured. The force-field can absorb, release, and redirect energy directed against it or near it. Trey can extend his force-field around other people and objects within a distance of approximately ten feet. The force field is often invisible, always transparent, and can be reshaped into simple forms such as screens, bubbles, and domes. Athena has granted him unlimited passage to and from the other dimensional realm of Olympus. The breastplate also has unexplained mystical properties.
