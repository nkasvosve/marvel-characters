Powers  Agent X's extremely powerful healing factor allows him to recover from otherwise fatal wounds, even regenerating entire limbs within hours. His patchwork memory safeguards him from telepathic intrusion. He also possesses above-average strength, speed, dexterity, and is a talented hand-to-hand combatant, proficient with virtually any weapon, as well as a gifted marksman, having telepathically absorbed the Black Swan's years of training.
